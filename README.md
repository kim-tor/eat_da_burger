## Description
Create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

## Installation
To begin I ran an npm install and also installed express, express-handlebars and mysql. To use the app I ran the command in my CLI to connect to the server. Once connected to the server I went to localhost:8080 which took me to the landing page. 


## Usage
Once on the page you will see a list of burgers. You can then select to devour the ones that are listed or to add a new burger to the list .... and then devour that.
